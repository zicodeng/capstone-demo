                    <h2>Boeing Employees' Credit Union (BECU)</h2>
                    <p>
                        BECU is a credit union originally established to serve employees of The Boeing Company. BECU was founded as Fellowship Credit
                        Union in 1935 by 18 Boeing employees, and was named Boeing Employees' Credit Union for much of its
                        history. Its headquarters are located in Tukwila, Washington. As of September 30, 2017, BECU had
                        over $17.5 billion in assets and over 1.06 million members, making it the largest credit union in
                        Washington and fourth largest in the United States.

                    <p>
                        BECU has grown significantly over the last decade, and continues to experience about 10% year-over-year-growth. BECU has
                        outgrown its current incident management tools and needs a new system to help staff quickly and effectively
                        resolve critical incidents.

                    <p>
                        We created an online portal for the end-to-end management of high and critical technology incidents for BECU IT employees
                        so that they can work as smartly and quickly as possible to restore services for their members.

                        <h2>Real-Time Collaborative Dashboard</h2>
                        <p>
                            The biggest challenge for BECU IT incident management team was lack of a collaborative tool dedicated for incident management.
                            They often had to switch between different systems such as ServiceNow and manage from there.
                            If an incident manager makes a change in one system, other team members are often not immediately
                            informed. This of course is not very efficient especially during a high critical incident. Our
                            software perfectly solves this problem by introducing a real-time collaborative experience. Anyone
                            who is currently watching or participating an incident will automatically get the most recent
                            update on the dashboard. This saves incident managers a large amount of time by not having them
                            to call or email their team members about the update.

                        <p>
                            Creating a completely new software from scratch is easier than building a software that integrates with currently existing
                            systems, because integration often limits developers to certain technologies and requires them
                            to spend time learning existing tools first. For this project, there are two major integrations:
                            integration with ServiceNow for data fetching, manipulation, and storage; integration with Azure
                            AD for user authentication and authorization.

                            Guiding by the philosophy of "putting people first," BECU cares deeply about their members. We sympathize with it. We want
                            to design and build a people-oriented product that empowers all IT employees at BECU to handle
                            critical technology incidents quickly and painlessly. While BECU makes it a priority to listen
                            to the members, we want to make an effort to hear from IT employees themselves to understand
                            their pain points and gather valuable ideas. We always think from usersâ€™ perspectives and strive
                            to help.

                        <p>
                            An incident manager sometimes wants to see who is currently participating in an incident. A participant can be an on-call
                            team member or a vendor. Current participants can search other users and are eligible for manually
                            adding users as participants. To help incident managers save time manually adding and removing
                            participants, the portal is smart enough to automatically add users when they click into an incident
                            view or remove them from current participant list when they leave the incident view. To help
                            incident managers obtain absolute control and analyze participant contributions, user activities
                            are also tracked. Sometimes an incident manager might leave for a different incident or for other
                            reasons. The portal also supports to switch between incident managers.
